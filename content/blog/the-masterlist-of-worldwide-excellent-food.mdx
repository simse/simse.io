A simpler and more lenient Michelin alternative. These are restaurants I've been to where the food as been beyond incredible. I don't travel too much, but I often find myself in cities with great food and diverse cuisines. If you ever find yourself in one these cities, please go to one of these restaurants.

## Lucknow 49

**London, United Kingdom — Indian — $$$**

At Lucknow 49 you find a small, cosy restaurant with polite and attentive staff. The menu is short but packed with goodies and offers authentic Indian dishes. This is one restaurant where you won't be ordering a butter chicken curry. The food here is absolutely incredible and the sauces are creamy yet spicy, while the meat is tender and flavorful. They also have a sizeable selection of vegetarian delights. [Website.](http://lucknowldn.com/)

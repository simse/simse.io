A simpler and more lenient Michelin alternative. These are restaurants I've been to where the food as been beyond incredible. I don't travel too much, but I often find myself in cities with great food and diverse cuisines. If you ever find yourself in one these cities, please go to one of these restaurants.

## Lucknow 49
**London, United Kingdom — Indian — $$$**

At Lucknow 49 you find a small, cosy restaurant with polite and attentive staff. The menu is short but packed with goodies and offers authentic Indian dishes. This is one restaurant where you won't be ordering a butter chicken curry. The food here is absolutely incredible and the sauces are creamy yet spicy, while the meat is tender and flavorful. They also have a sizeable selection of vegetarian delights.

## Lucky Sushi
**Slagelse, Denmark — Japanese — $$**

I have never been to Japan so I can't tell you how authentic this restaurant is. What I can tell you, is that I didn't think I liked sushi before I came here. It turns out I love sushi! They have classic seaweed, sticky rice and raw fish sushi, but also tons of other combinations with sauces, vegetables and whatnot. They offer a la carte, but the most popular option is the to-order all you can eat. That's right, you can order as much as you want (but only for two hours). Apart from Slagelse, there's two more locations in Greve and Køge.

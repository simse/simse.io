Today, I'm returning with another rendition of "Game of the Month." This month my life has consisted of eating, sleeping and playing Rimworld (and Game of Thrones, but that's a discussion for another time).

Rimworld is one of those excellent games where the creator is perfectly aware of just how good the game is, so it never goes on sale. Rimworld is â‚¬30, it will always be, and it's well worth it.

Rimworld is a sci-fi base building/story generator game. You start with 1, 3, or 5 characters (with varying levels of technology) and your goal is to leave the planet. To leave the planet, you must build a ship and defend it, travel across the planet to a friendly AI ship or house a Count from the royal family as a guest for two weeks, and make sure he is happy. Along the way you'll face all sorts of challenges. Some are devastating, some are simply annoying. One time while playing I lost half my colony because it was cold and I had no food. Darn.

You'll have to defend against raiders. Treat wounded. Take and recruit prisoners. Grow food. Tailor clothes. Harvest plants. And so much more. While it may sound overwhelming and complex, it's really not. 

You get very attached to the characters. Even though it's been a while since I finished my first playthrough, I can still remember some of my colonists. Their names, what they were like, who they liked. That's pretty impressive.

Sometimes I would eat dinner with my family, then go play, lose track of time only to still be playing when my dad got up and left for work. That's when I knew I had a problem and that I had to put away the game for a while. 

But yeah, to sum up it's an excellent game and I can wholeheartedly recommend it. Bye bye now.

Early programming languages were created mostly by Americans and Brits. These early languages shaped syntax that most modern languages more or less share. Basic C code will look familiar to many programmers mainly because C was likely the starting point for the syntax design of those languages. Here's a small example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
    int num1 = 10;
    int num2 = 8;
    printf("No, I am not a minor, I am %d years old.", num1 + num2);

    return 0;
}
```

And the same in Javscript 游땠 (forgive the if statement, that's a surprise tool for later)

```javascript
let num1 = 10;
let num2 = 8;
if(true) {
    console.log("No, I am not a minor, I am " + num1 + num2 + " years old.");
}
```

As you can see you, there's several similarities. `{` and `}` denote code blocks. `;` to end lines. `(` and `)` to call functions. `"` for strings. All of these choices are brilliant when you're programming on American (or derivative) keyboards, but on other keyboards it can ruin the flow.

I am Danish, so when I talk to my friends back home, I need my trusty 칝, 칮 and 친. I am also a programmer, so Danish keyboard layout is out of the question. Are you in a similiar boat? Here's how I solved it.


# 칝, 칮, 친 on Windows

Install [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) and put the script below that fits your needs in your startup folder. You can find your startup folder by pressing Win+R and then `shell:startup`.

## Spare keys
I have a trusty Apple Keyboard where the F keys go all the way up to F19. So it works quite to map the new letters to F13, F14 and F15.
```autohotkey
#NoEnv

F13::칝
+F13::칁

F14::칮
+F14::칒

F15::친
+F15::칀
```

## Sacrifice keys
If you don't have any spare keys, you can override three existing ones. Overriding F10, F11 and F12 is probably not a good idea.
```autohotkey
#NoEnv

F10::칝
+F10::칁

F11::칮
+F11::칒

F12::친
+F12::칀
```

## Peaceful co-existence
You could assign the letters to three existing keys but use a modifier such as alt. The modifier symbol for alt is `!`. Control is `^`. `#` is the Windows key.
```autohotkey
#NoEnv

!F10::칝
!+F10::칁

!F11::칮
!+F11::칒

!F12::친
!+F12::칀
```

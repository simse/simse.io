title: Chrome OS Is Insanely Powerful
category: Chrome OS

I'm a big fan of Linux and I use it whenever I can. Unfortunately, most of the Linux distros I tried on my laptop didn't run that well. I had issues with graphical glitches, wouldn't shut down, wouldn't sleep or wake up and most of them just didn't "feel" right.

One night I figured I'd try Chrome OS just to see how that felt, and it's fantastic**.** I love it. Even as a power user it's a perfectly capable OS, and I am extremely impressed. I think you will be too.

Unfortunately, there isn't that much online content about Chrome OS, so I thought I'd try to fill that hole with a couple of blog posts, and this is the first one. This post is about the OS and what makes it so good.

Chrome OS operating system created by Google to run on Chromebooks. The main idea is that so many people live most of their online lives in the browser, so their computer may as well just *be* a browser. Chrome OS essentially cuts away everything but the browser. By doing this, you're also saving battery and allowing the OS to run on much cheaper hardware, paving the way for a range of computers costing as little as $100, that are actually pretty damn good.

Because Chrome OS is designed to be able to run on very cheap hardware, it is heavily optimised to use whatever resources it has to always feel smooth, snappy and fast. When you run Chrome OS on powerful and capable hardware like the [Pixelbook Go](https://store.google.com/gb/product/pixelbook_go), it feels like the entire UI has been blessed with a thin layer of butter.

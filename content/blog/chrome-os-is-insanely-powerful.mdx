title: Chrome OS Is Insanely Powerful
category: Chrome OS

I'm a big fan of Linux and I use it whenever I can. Unfortunately, most of the Linux distros I tried on my laptop didn't run that well. I had issues with graphical glitches, wouldn't shut down, wouldn't sleep or wake up and most of them just didn't "feel" right.

One night I figured I'd try Chrome OS just to see how that felt, and it's **fantastic**!I love it. Even as a power user it's a perfectly capable OS, and I am extremely impressed. I think you will be too.

Unfortunately, there isn't that much online content about Chrome OS, so I thought I'd try to fill that hole with a couple of blog posts, and this is the first one. This post is about the OS and what makes it so good.

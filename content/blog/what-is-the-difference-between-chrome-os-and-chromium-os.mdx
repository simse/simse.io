title: What Is the Difference Between Chrome OS and Chromium OS?
category: Chrome OS
---
As part of my series of posts about Chrome OS, I'd like to write about the differences between Chromium OS and Chrome OS.

The Chrome browser is a version of the Chromium browser distributed by Google. Chrome has additional features added by Google such as automatic updates and additional video format support.

Likewise, Chrome OS is version of Chromium OS distributed by Google. Chrome OS adds support for Android apps via the Play Store. It also adds the Google Assistant.

You can compile Chromium OS yourself and install it on your own device, while Chrome OS is only distributed on OEM Chromebooks.

Can you still install Chrome OS on your own device? Yes you can, but it's a bit more difficult than just installing Chromium OS.

It's quite similiar to the way Android is built an distributed. Google works actively on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), while distrubuting a custom Android build with their Pixel phones. You can often install a Pixel-like ROM on your own Android phone, but it's a bit more involved.

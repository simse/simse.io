Welcome to a new blog post series that I will presumably abandon immediately after posting this. In this series, I will post my favourite game of the month every month until I die, maybe. Those are big words.. "until I die." If nothing bad happens to me and I live to be 90, would I still be playing games then? Only time will tell.

So as I said every month I will pick my favourite game. The game doesn't have to be new or from that month, just something I have played recently. These posts are not meant to be in-depth reviews, but more of a thumbs up. I expect in the future you would be able to look over my previous recommendations and use that to make educated decisions.

Right, enough rambling. My first pick is Doom (2016). Doom is simply pure stupid fun, and that's okay! Every art form has impressive art and entertaining art. These overlap, sometimes they don't. Take for example The Fast and The Furious, they don't necessarily have great cinematography or complex and moving storylines, but they are very entertaining and sometimes that's what you need. Doom won't make you cry and the story won't grip you, because that's not what it's about. All you have to do is shoot, you have to shoot a lot. You have 10 (I think) weapons to choose from, and some of them make everyone explode on the spot others cut them to pieces. And while this massacre goes on, the game will happily blast metal and psychedelic trance.

So yeah, I love it.

Another thing that I feel many people neglect, or maybe rather feel is unimportant, is the performance of the game. It's good, it's excellent. The graphics are gorgeous and even on Ultra 1440p, my PC handled it just fine. My GPU is an RTX 2060, which is a great card but still not _that_ expensive. 

To me, graphics and the optimisation of a game are just as important as the gameplay in the game. 

Anyways, to sum up: gun goes boom, simon goes yes sir.

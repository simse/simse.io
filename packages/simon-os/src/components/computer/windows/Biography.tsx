					I've always been fascinated with technology, and as a child I broke
					many things through tinkering.
				</p>

				<p>
					Around the age of 10, I learned the HTML, CSS and JS basics from
					Youtube. When I was 12, my dad got me a subscription to Treehouse,
					where I learned about PHP, Wordpress and jQuery.{" "}
				</p>

				<p>
					Since then I've known I wanted to be a Software Engineer, and now 11
					years later, I am!
				</p>

				<p>
					Currently I work at The LEGO Group as a Junior Software Engineer doing
					all sorts of cool stuff.

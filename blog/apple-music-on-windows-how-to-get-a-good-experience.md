title: Apple Music on Windows; How to Get a Good Experience
---
Apple just killed iTunes on their latest macOS 10.15 release, but Windows users are still stuck using a highly unoptimized iTunes if they subscribe to Apple Music. In this small blog post, I'm going to go over a few things you can do to improve your Apple Music experience on Windows.

I have been a happy Spotify user for around 5 years. The algorithm knows me, I like the recommendations and I love their apps, except one. Out of spite, Spotify never delivered a good Apple Watch app. If you have Apple Music you can save songs on the watch, stream over WiFi and 4G using only the watch a pair of headphones, play songs using Siri, and the Spotify app does none of that. Because of this, I've switched to Apple Music, and it's definitely not bad, but Apple has neglected their Windows users a bit. Fortunately, there's a couple of good solutions.

When streaming Apple Music on Windows you have several options. iTunes, Apple Music Web or any of the third-party clients.  If you're happy with using iTunes, great! If not, let's go over your options. 

**Apple Music Web**

**FeverTunes**

Go ahead and try them out and see which one you prefer. If you're okay with having Apple Music in the web, we're done. If not, there's one more step. If you're using Chrome, you can add any website as an "app" on your desktop. 

Adding Apple Music as an desktop app

Go to your preferred web player. Press the three dots in the top right corner. Press "more tools" > create shortcut and give it a good name, make sure to check "Open as window". An icon should appear on your desktop which you can then add to your taskbar if you wish.



Best of luck! And yes, I'm 14 year old girl who loves Billie Eyelash :)

title: Fixing the FPS Cap in RAGE 2
---
There is no FPS cap on the PC version of RAGE 2, but I still found I couldn't go over 30FPS playing at 1080p on my VEGA 64.

**The fix was to disable Resolution Scale.** You should safely be able to do this if you're PC is more than capable of running the game.

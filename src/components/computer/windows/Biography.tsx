        I've always been fascinated with technology, and as a child I broke many
        things through tinkering.
      </p>

      <p>
        Around the age of 10, I learned the HTML, CSS and JS basics from
        Youtube. When I was 12, my dad got me a subscription to Treehouse, where
        I learned about PHP, Wordpress and jQuery. </p>
        
        <p>Since then I've known I
        wanted to be a Software Engineer, and now 11 years later, I am!</p>

        <p>
        Currently I work at The LEGO Group as a Junior Software Engineer doing
        all sorts of cool stuff.

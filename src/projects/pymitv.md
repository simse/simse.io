## Introduction
This package was developed to interface with the Xiaomi TV 3 series through their local HTTP API using Python. The package has both the ability to discover TVs and control them. The TV lineup in question is this [one.](http://www.mi.com/en/mitv3s/65/) It should be noted, that all the TV logic and hardware is in the soundbar. Thus, if you have a soundbar that looks identical to the one in the picture, you should be golden with this library.

##### Supported models
- Mi TV 3s (all sizes)

##### Not sure if supported models
- Mi TV 4A (all sizes)
- Mi TV 4c (all sizes)

## Installing
Easy as pie! Just use `pip`.

**Most systems**
```
pip install pymitv
```

**Or if you have multiple Python versions**
```
python3 -m pip install pymitv
```

## Usage
The package includes three modules: `Discover`, `Control` and `TV`. Each have their role, as implied by their names.

### Discovering TVs
#### `Discover.scan()`
This method is used to scan the local network for TVs.

**Arguments**

| Name | Required | Default value | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `stop_on_first` | No | `True` | Whether or not the method should continue scanning for TVs after finding its first one. Only needed for people with multiple Xiaomi TVs. |
| `base_ip` | No | `0` | Instead of looking for the base IP, you can give it to the function in the format of `192.168.0.` |

**Example usage**

```python
import Discover from pymitv

discover = Discover.scan()
print(discover)
```

#### `Discover.check_ip()`
Used by `Discover.scan()` to check if a TV is present at the IP.

**Arguments**

| Name              | Required | Default value | Purpose                                                     |
|-------------------|----------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ip`              | Yes      | None          | The IP to check.                                            |

**Example usage**

```python
import Discover from pymitv

print(Discover().check_ip('192.168.0.45'))
```

### Controlling TVs
This is where the `Control` class comes in handy. The class has a bunch of predefined keystrokes:
- `turn_on`
- `turn_off`
- `sleep`
- `wake`
- `up`
- `down`
- `right`
- `left`
- `home`
- `enter`
- `back`
- `menu`
- `volume_up`
- `volume_down`

#### `Control.send_keystrokes(ip, keystrokes)`
Sends a set of keystrokes to a TV at `ip`

**Arguments**

| Name              | Required | Default value | Purpose                                                     |
|-------------------|----------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ip`              | Yes      | None          | The IP of the TV to send keystroke(s) to.                   |
| `keystrokes`      | Yes      | None          | Keystroke(s) to send. E.g. `Control.sleep`                  |

**Using the `wait` keystroke**

Using this keyword in a sequence of keystrokes will make the method sleep for 0.4 seconds which is the effective time it takes for the TV to listen to new keystrokes.

**Example usage**

```python
import Control from pymitv

Control().sendKeystrokes(Control.sleep)
```

### TV as a class
There is a class representation of the TV which will take an IP address. It has a range of control functions, and will keep track of on/off state (provided the script running is kept alive).

**Example usage**

```python
from pymitv import TV

tv = TV('192.168.0.41')

tv.is_on() #Return False
tv.wake() #Will wake the TV
tv.up() #Will press key up
```

All keystrokes from the `Control` class are available with the exception of `turn_on`. This is because, you can't actually turn on the TV if it's completely off. Instead, use `wake` and `sleep`.

## Accessing the local API exposed by the TV
This can be useful if you don't wish to use the Python package (this one), but you'd rather implement your own version. Below you'll find everything you need.

#### Finding the TV IP
To find the IP of your TV you need to scan your network for clients. You can use an application like [*Advanced IP Scanner*](http://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/) for Windows and [*LanScan*](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lanscan/id472226235?mt=12) for MacOS. Both these applications resolves the MAC address to give you the name of the manufacturer. However, if you have multiple Xiaomi products it can still prove difficult to find the right one. **Fear not!** The MAC address should start with `00:9E:C8`.

#### Check TV status
To check if the TV is on, use the following request:
`http://TV_IP:6095/request?action=isalive`

The above will return something along the lines of:
```json
{
	"status": 0,
	"msg": "success",
	"data": {
		"devicename": "客厅的小米电视",
		"ip": "TV_IP:6095",
		"feature": ["power"],
		"url": ["http:\/\/bilibili.kankanews.com\/video\/av\\d+\/", "http:\/\/www.bilibili.tv\/video\/av\\d+\/"],
		"platform": 606,
		"build": 1381,
		"version": 16777500
	}
}
```

**BEWARE! If the TV is in standby mode, this request will still return as if it were on. Currently there is no way to check if the TV is actually on.**

#### Send keystroke
To send a keystroke use the following request:
`http://TV_IP:6095/controller?action=keyevent&keycode=KEYCODE`

Instead of `KEYCODE`, you should write an actual keycode. These are the available ones:

| Key/button | keycode | action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| On/off toggle | `power` | Turns the TV on or off |
| Up | `up` | Goes up |
| Down | `down` | Goes down |
| Left | `left` | Goes left |
| Right | `right` | Goes right |
| Enter | `enter` | Affirms selection |
| Home | `home` | Returns to home screen |
| Back | `back` | Goes one step back |
| Menu | `menu` | Opens options menu |
| Volume up | `volumeup` | Increases volume by 1 |
| Volume down | `volumedown` | Decreases volume by 1 |

# The Light Sensor

For the microcontroller I bought an [Adafruit QT Py ESP32-S2 WiFi](https://www.adafruit.com/product/5325) which I chose because it has WiFi and the I2C port has a STEMMA QT connector so I didn’t have to solder anything. I do have a soldering iron in my drawer, but I’m more of a software guy.

The light sensor I chose is an [Adafruit BH1750](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4681) which is an Ambient Light Sensor that measure the light level in lux and has a range from 0 to ~65K.

The equation I came up with is as follows:

introduction goes here

# 1. Don't hijack scrolling behaviour
This rule boils down to: **don't implement smooth scrolling**.

Different browsers, across different OSes, using different input methods scroll differently. On mobile or if using a touchpad, the user is grabbing the page and expects the movement of their finger to be mapped to the movement of the page.

When using a scrollwheel, the scrolling is usually "stepped". However, most browsers smooth the steps so it doesn't feel like the page is jumping.

In any case, smooth scroll is disruptive, and pretty much never a good choice.


# 2. Don't style the window scrollbar
The main scrollbar used to indicate the scroll position of the page should be left untouched.

# 3. Don't change the page title after load
It's possible to change the page title after the user clicks away from the tab to something like: "Come back we miss you!". You can even flash a message. **Don't do this.** It's poor taste.

A notable exception: Twitter.

# 4. Don't play sound until user interaction
No pop-ups should make any sound. No buttons should click.

The only acceptable times to play sound, is when it's obvious. Like pressing a play button. Or if context allows, like you're on Youtube or a podcast site, it makes sense.

# 5. 

- Don't set an upper limit for password length
- Don't use overly specific password rules
- Do allow copy/paste always
- Do allow showing plain text password
- Do use lax form validation
- Do label form inputs properly
- Don't show pop-ups when user is leaving site
- Do consider layout shift

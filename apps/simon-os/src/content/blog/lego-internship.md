On Friday the 1st of March, my internship of almost two years at The LEGO Group in London came to an end. Most ordinary internships don't last two years, and my circumstances certainly weren't ordinary.

Before I reflect on the past two years, I have to give you a bit of background.

### Background

In 2019 I graduated from high school in Denmark with an International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma. It takes two years to complete, it's very difficult but it's widely recognised internationally.

I didn't do very well, and with my results there weren't many universities that would take me. I was offered a place at the University of Sussex, provided I did a foundation year first. Which would mean 1 year of math and programming basics, then 3 years of Computer Science.

Unfortunately I never finished the foundation year, because in March of 2020 I moved back home because of COVID-19. Teaching moving online, but I ended up just withdrawing instead of completing the year. That was certainly a mistake, but no need to dwell on that.

Then I went on to spend about a year in my parents basement playing video games. I also tried and failed to get in to Groningen University in The Netherlands.

In March 2021 my dad got me a job at LEGO in the same department as him. Within the department, there was a small team doing various technical tasks supporting everyone else. They were busy, and could use an extra pair of hands.

I eneded up being hired as a Student Worker, which is a position intended for those in university to make extra money on the side, gain experience and do odds and ends to help out. I wasn't in university at that time, so I just worked full-time.

In June 2021 I got accepted into the Computer Science programme at Kingston University. It's not a top university, but it would allow to live in London, which is where I wanted to live and work after graduating.

In Septemper 2021 the time had come to move to London and say goodbye to my job at LEGO. They asked if I would be interested in staying employed if I could work remotely. I said yes, but unfortunately it didn't work out.

Certainly a shame, but no big deal. I had saved money and I had gained a bit experience to add to my CV. I left the job on good terms, and I was looking forward to starting university.

A few months later, around November, I get a call from one of my old co-workers. He tells me he's been talking to a few people at the LEGO office in London. It just so happens that most of those working on [lego.com](https://lego.com), does so from the London office!

I was put in touch with two engineers, and we had an initial interview with the goal of bringing me on as an intern. After that, a few months went by and I didn't hear much. I followed up once, but there was no progress, so I thought it the ship had sailed.

What I didn't know, was that there _was_ no existing internship to offer, so they had to create one. That included figuring out stuff like: pay, hours, salaried or not, reporting to whom, working in which team. It was a lot of work, and I'm very grateful for the effort they put in to make it happen.

In January 2022, I did a technical interview. It consisted of me going through a take-home task, followed up by some technical questions.

Some questions I could answer, others I couldn't. I thought I was toast, but I wasn't. In February 2022 I was offered the internship which would start the following month on March 6th.

The special thing about my internship is that I worked part-time so I could attend university at the same time.

With that very long background out of the way, I'd like to reflect on the past two years of working for The LEGO Group in London.

### Reflections

During my internship, I've worked in 7 different teams. This means I've seen pretty much the entire range team types: backend only, frontend mostly, full-stack and platform.

The lego.com website is built with Next.js, so it uses React and we prefer Typescript over Javascript. I believe using Typescript has had a significant positive impact on my mood over the past two years.

The biggest I want to point out, is how everyone respected me despite my very junior title. That's actually a big part of the engineering culture at the company. Titles are about responsibilities, but it doesn't determine who is right or wrong.

My ideas and opinions were valued just as much as everyone elses. That's a fact I quickly forgot about, but it was always the case, and I appreciate that.
